# Volcanoes
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcano Volcanoes are places in the Earth where the crust is not connected, so that there is a direct channel to the mantle. Because of this, magma flows from the mantle to the opening, shaping chambers and coming out as lava. Volcanoes are generally found at plate boundaries, where the crust is not connected. 

## Types of volcanoes
When a magma erupts to the surface as lava, volcanoes can form depending on the stickiness of the magma, the amount of gas contained within it, its composition or the way it reached the surface. The two major forms of volcanoes created from this are stratovolcano and shield volcanoes, though many different volcanic features can accompany it, such as cinder cones or lava domes.

### Shield Volcanoes
Volcanoes that produce low viscosity or runny lava have currents that spread far from its source, creating gentle slopes. Repeated eruptions of this result in a steady accumulation of magma sheets, building a distinctive form. These are classified as shield volcanoes, as the fluid basaltic lava flows give its shape a smooth shield-like appearance resembles a er from stratovolcanoes through the type of lava it produces. Shield volcanoes have near-constant eruwarrior's shield lying on the ground. In consequence of its magmatic composition, shield volcanoes diffptive activity for long periods of time when they are active, resulting in the slow formation of edifices that can reach enormous dimensions. This causes mature shield volcanoes to be the largest volcanic features on Earth. A notable example of this is the Mauna Loa, stretching 4,169 metres above sea level and over 100 kilometres wide at its base.

### Stratovolcanoes
Stratovolcanoes, or composite volcanoes, are conical volcanoes built up by many layers of hardened lava and tephra, causing steep slopes. These volcanoes are shaped from viscous, sticky lava as opposed to runny lava. The volcano follows periodic intervals of explosive and effusive eruptions, where a magma chamber 5-10 kilometres below the vent releases an overflow of pressurised gas. The released flowing lava will cool and harden before spreading far due to its high viscosity, causing a bulging apex. An example of a stratovolcano is Mount Pinatubo, with an eruption that caused deaths and considerable local damage in the historic past. Its bursts released aerosols around the world; deploying 22 million tonnes of toxic gas into the stratosphere. As of now, stratovolcanoes only exist on Earth.

## Case study: Mount Kilauea  
help idk what to write 
1. Find an active volcano
2. Find an inactive volcano
3. Find a wikipedia of the volcanoes
4. Find threats it poses to life.
5. Location
6. Eruptions.
7. Type
8. Picture

I just posted that on reddit

Mount Kilauea is a volcano in the southeast of the Big Island of Hawaii. It has erupted many times, with the first eruption predating humans. the oldest exposed lava is over 2800 years old. It Kilauea is one of the most active volcanoes in the world, having erupted many times and continuing to erupt even today. It made headlines in 2019 as lava from the Hawaiian chain of volcanoes seeped towards cities.

Hey 
How long can you stay
17 more min
You better finish by then
can you just leave vsc open until 10pm
I gotta turn off my laptop at 9 30
thats ok
Ok

also can you get you get on discord so we don't have to have this comments section thing
no
how do we add images
-->
