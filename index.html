        Volcanoes
    </h1>
    <p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcano Volcanoes are places in the Earth where the crust is not connected, so that there is a direct channel to the mantle. Because of this, magma flows from the mantle to the opening, shaping chambers and coming out as lava. Volcanoes are generally found at plate boundaries, where the crust is not connected.
